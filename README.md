# Product Insights AI üöÄ

An intelligent web application that takes any e-commerce product URL, scrapes its data in real-time, and uses AI to generate a clean, refined, and data-rich summary card. This tool transforms messy product pages into structured, easy-to-digest information.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Real-Time Web Scraping**: Utilizes a headless browser (Puppeteer) on the backend to scrape live data from any product URL, bypassing issues with sites that rely heavily on JavaScript.
-   **AI-Powered Data Refinement**: Leverages a powerful AI model (via Puter.js) to process the raw scraped text. It intelligently shortens titles, extracts key features, and formats data into a clean JSON object.
-   **Dynamic Product Summary Card**: A sleek, modern, and responsive UI that displays the refined product information. The card only shows the data points that were successfully found and processed, ensuring a clean and relevant view every time.
-   **Optimized Performance**: The backend scraper is optimized to block unnecessary resources like images and stylesheets, significantly speeding up data extraction.
-   **Serverless-Ready**: Built with Next.js and configured to be easily deployable on serverless platforms like Vercel.

üîÑ How It Works
URL Submission: 

The user enters an e-commerce product URL into the input field on the frontend.

API Request: 

The frontend sends a POST request to the /api/scrape backend endpoint with the URL in the request body.

Scraping with Puppeteer: 

The API endpoint launches a headless Puppeteer instance, navigates to the provided URL, and extracts raw product data (title, price, description, specs, etc.) from the page's HTML.

Raw Data Response: 

The API sends the raw, unstructured scraped data back to the frontend as a JSON object.

AI Refinement: 

The frontend constructs a detailed prompt containing the raw data and sends it to the Puter.js AI service. The prompt instructs the AI to act as a data processor and return a clean, structured JSON object.

Display Results: 

The frontend receives the refined JSON from the AI and uses it to render the final, polished ProductCard component for the user.

üîå API Endpoint
POST /api/scrape
